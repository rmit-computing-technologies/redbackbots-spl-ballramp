Preamble: RedbackBots as part of the AI Innovation Lab at RMIT University
releases software it uses at RoboCup competitions
for the benefit of the RoboCup community, including teams in the
Standard Platform League. We intend to enable teams to benchmark their own scientific
approaches in RoboCup competitions. We also hope that the scientific community
will benefit through the publication of their findings. A second reason for
RedbackBots releasing its code is that source code is the most solid
documentation of how problems were actually solved.
